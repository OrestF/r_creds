# RCreds

RCreds makes working with Rails 5.2 credentials easier

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'r_creds'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install r_creds

## Usage

RCreds give an ability to read credentials in credentials.yml, ENV or use default value!

```ruby
# returns value from credentials.yml for current environment 
RCreds.fetch(:payment_system, :secret_key) 
```
```ruby
# returns value from credentials.yml for current environment or default 
RCreds.fetch(:redis, :url, default: 'redis://localhost:6379/0')
```
```ruby
# if value is set in as ENV variable it will be fetched if it's not set in credentials.yml
# keys concatenates as in following example
ENV['REDIS_URL'] = 'redis://real_redis_url'
RCreds.fetch(:redis, :url, default: 'redis://localhost:6379/0') # output: redis://real_redis_url
```
RCreds search for values in following order: credentials.yml > ENV > default:
